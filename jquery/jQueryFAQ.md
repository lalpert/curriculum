### jQuery FAQ

- The `<script>` tag
  - Where does it go in the HTML document?
    - The bottom of the body tag.  
  - Why?
    - If we put it in the HEAD tag, the browser will go get the JS file and won't draw the HTML or CSS until it finishes downloading.  We don't want to show our users a blank screen while they wait so we tell the browser to draw the HTML and CSS first before it tries to load any JavaScript.
  - What are some of the `<script>` tag's attributes?
    - `type` identifies the language of the code embedded within the script tag.  Ex: type="text/javascript", "application/javascript"
    - `src` tells the browser where to find the file
  - Add JavaScript to a webpage
    - Create a script tag to load jQuery in a webpage.
    - `<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.0.0.min.js" integrity="sha256-JmvOoLtYsmqlsWxa7mDSLMwa6dZ9rrIdtrrVYRnDRH0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
    - The `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes are used for Subresource Integrity (SRI) checking. This allows browsers to ensure that resources hosted on third-party servers have not been tampered with. Use of SRI is recommended as a best-practice, whenever libraries are loaded from a third-party source. Read more at srihash.org
- Selecting a DOM element
  - We can select elements to change with the syntax `$('.class')` and `$('#id')`
  - Demonstrate by using `console.log($('.someClass'));`
  - What did jQuery give us?
    - One (or more) matching elements and any of its child elements.
  - The DOM: Document Object Module
    - A *model* of our HTML *document* in a programming language called javascript.  Because our HTML is represented in JavaScript, we can write JavaScript code to change our web page.
    - The structure of that model is a like a tree.  HTML elements are sometimes called `nodes` when we talk about them using in their DOM or JavaScript representation.
      - Ex: "This HTML element is missing a closing tag." vs "I want to select the second paragraph node." or "I want to add a new paragraph node."
- Loading Our Own Script
  - `<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/myScript.js"></script>`
  - Scripts can load at different times.  We want to wait until jQuery has loaded before we try to use it.
    - $(document).ready()
- Basic debugging in the Developer Console
  - How do we know that jQuery is loaded?
    - Open the developer console and type in $
  - How can we tell that our own script loaded?
    - Try adding a console.log statement.
